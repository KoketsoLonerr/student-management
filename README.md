# Student Database Management

## Overview

The Student Database Management System is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the management of student information within an educational institution. It encompasses various functionalities to efficiently handle student data, attendance tracking, exam grades, class schedules, and teacher information. This project aims to provide a centralized platform for administrators, teachers, and students to access and manage relevant information seamlessly.

## Functionalities

1. **Storage of Basic Student Details**:
   - The system allows storing essential student information such as name, age, class, birth date, parent’s name, parent’s occupation, etc. This eliminates the need for repetitive data entry and automates the process of managing student profiles.

2. **Mapping Student Profiles and Classes to Teachers**:
   - Establishes a relationship between student profiles, their respective classes, and the teachers responsible for teaching those classes.
   - Utilizes individual tables for student details, teacher information, and a schedule table to map classes to teachers.

3. **Management of Exam Grades**:
   - Facilitates the storage of exam grades and individual marks for students.
   - Enables administrators and teachers to input and track student performance in various exams and assessments.

4. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Implements an attendance logging system to manage student attendance records.
   - Allows for the recording and monitoring of student attendance, aiding in the identification of trends and patterns.

## Instructions for Running the Project
